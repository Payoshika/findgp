          <p>
            As an international student beginning my Master's studies in the UK,
            I arrived with a longstanding history of asthma, managed with
            prescribed inhaler medication since childhood.
          </p>

          <p>
            New to the UK and unfamiliar with the NHS, I made what seemed like a
            practical choice: registering with the GP practice closest to my
            apartment. I didn't read reviews or research options—proximity was
            my only criteria.
          </p>

          <p>
            This proved to be a costly oversight. My new GP was overwhelmed with
            patients, especially international students. Getting an appointment
            required calling right after the opening hours started, often missed
            due to lectures I had to attend. Though I needed a prescription, the
            difficult access meant I kept postponing my visit.
          </p>

          <p>
            On December 30th, my asthma suddenly worsened. When I finally
            secured an appointment, it was already too late—I was immediately
            referred to a large hospital due to my severe breathing
            difficulties. The next ten days were spent recovering from a crisis
            that could have been prevented.
          </p>

          <p>
            During my recovery, I discovered something frustrating: my GP had
            consistently poor reviews, while another practice just a short
            distance away was highly rated. Had I known this earlier, my health
            emergency might have been avoided entirely.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created this tool to help international students and anyone
            unfamiliar with the UK healthcare system quickly identify
            well-reviewed GP practices. Because when it comes to health,
            sometimes the closest option isn't the best option—and having that
            information can make all the difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope this tool helps you find the right GP for your needs, so you
            can focus on what really matters: your health and well-being.
